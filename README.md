# VBA-Challenge

## Summary of Project
This repository contains a vba script and screenshots of a completed bootcamp assignment. 

The assignment required me to loop through a year of stock ticker data the included opening price, high/low price, closing price and volume for each day throughout the course of 1 year. The workbook contained 3 sheets with one year of data on each sheet. 

We were tasked with summarizing each unique stock ticker with the **yearly $ change, yearly % change and total annual volume.** 

In addition, a bonus assignment was offered to identify the stock with the **largest % increase, largest % decrease and the highest total annual volume.**
